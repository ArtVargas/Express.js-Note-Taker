# Express.js-Note-Taker
Challenge is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. This application was created in order to properly display the use of being able to write and take notes by using an Express back end. This in turn will retrieve all the necessary note data from a JSON file. Various notes of being able to track one day of activities such as grocery shopping at a specific time, making a phone call to a friend, etc. The process of creating this application proved to be quite difficult. The concepts of using Express.js, routing, and other various skillwork were really difficult to implement on a first try basis. In time the familiarity began to stay more and creating the application became routine clockwork which implemented all the various routes and functions needed to showcase all the functioning capabilities of the note taker challenge. The learning process will made this project more rewarding and time consuming which makes it stand on its own due to being a first time attempt at being able to replicate a fully functional note taker using Express.js with various API and html routes which will use the note data from a JSON file.
